    "Politics are divisive. We don't need a large dataset to prove that. But the data that is out there shows both sides of the US political spectrum support some form of increased vigilance when it comes to gun rights and laws, yet nothing happens. There have been countless studies of the issues on all sides: the practical, the logistic, cultural, revolutionary, constitutional, and the need for personal defense... but I wanted to look at the numbers myself. Numbers are hard to come by though. The gun lobby has prevented the CDC from collecting research on gun violence. There is no national gun registry where a data scientist might collect meta data on who gun owners are and their reasons, or even more simply how many there are. That said, I came across a [data set](https://www.kaggle.com/zusmani/us-mass-shootings-last-50-years) of mass shootings in the US. Here is what I found."

    "from August 1966 through early October 2017, there have been 398 mass shootings. These are shootings where at 4 or more people were killed or injured. Tragically, almost 2000 people have died in this method, and more then double, 4,352, have been killed or injured. More alarming is the trend at which these shootings are happening, from September 2012 to October 2017 roughly half of all the mass shootings have occurred. That is, the last five years have seen as many mass shootings as the previous 46 years."

    "How long do we have to wait to observer a new mass shooting? We could look at the entire dataset and just calculate the mean time between shootings, but the assumption gained from the above charts is that the rate of shootings is accelerating. Lets instead simply compare the mean time for the last five years roughly and the 46 years prior. This reveals a very alarming statistic, from 1966 to August 2012 there was a mass shooting, on average, every 86 days. However in the past five years the rate is almost 10 times faster, with an average of about 9 days. There might be some issues in the dataset, perhaps missed reporting, or something has seriously fallen apart over the last decade."
